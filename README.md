# git-trender
An example of a React headless app combined with Github's search API

Find a live version of the app here: [Git Trender](https://git-trender.herokuapp.com/)

## Features
- Save favourite git repos
- Filter by created date
- Filter by programming language
- Filter favourites (frontend only)
- Browser storage sync
- URL compatible with Github's search API endpoint

Updating the search params of the URL will filter the app's table, this should be totally compatible with Github's search API endpoint, so anything that works in there will work here as well.
